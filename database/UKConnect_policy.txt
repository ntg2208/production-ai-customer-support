## Ordering an Invoice

If you need an invoice for personal or business purposes, most UK organisations accept an e-ticket confirmation as an invoice. For specific requirements, invoices can be ordered using dedicated forms.

### Using E-ticket Confirmation as Invoice

Your e-ticket confirmation is recognised as a receipt throughout the UK and can be used for expense reimbursement and tax purposes.

You can order your e-ticket confirmation in your profile under "Bookings" via "E-documents (Invoice)" or "Passenger Receipt".

### Ordering an Invoice After Travel

We can send you a new booking confirmation free of charge up to 90 days after the ticket has been completely used. After 90 days, we charge £25 for each confirmation (maximum of five e-ticket confirmations).

### Special Invoice Requirements

For certain business requirements or specific accounting needs, we can issue detailed invoices on request. Contact our customer service team for assistance with special invoice formats.

## Payment Cards

### Card Security Number

For secure online payments, we require the card security number for all online bookings. This code validates your credit/debit card information.

**American Express**: 4-digit number above the card number on the front
**Mastercard**: 3-digit number on the back where the signature appears
**Visa**: 3-digit number on the back where the signature appears
**Maestro**: 3-digit number on the back where the signature appears

## Card Security

### Payment Security Standards

Following UK payment security regulations, we maintain enhanced security standards ensuring safe online transactions.

We comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, defining how we store, transmit, and process payment data. All payment data is encrypted to the highest safety standards.

### 3-D Secure Authentication

3-D Secure authentication is required for all credit and debit cards issued in the UK. This additional authentication step guarantees secure payments and reduces fraud risk.

**How 3-D Secure Works:**
1. Register your card via your bank's website (process varies by bank)
2. During transaction, you'll be redirected to your bank's website for additional authentication
3. Complete the authentication to finalize your booking

For 3-D Secure registration questions, contact your bank directly.

## Pay Monthly Option

### Who Can Use Pay Monthly?

You must be over 18 and a UK resident. This payment option is available for all UK rail journeys.

### What Does ID Verification Check?

ID verification prevents fraud and ensures the booking person is the actual account holder, preventing identity theft. You'll receive a smartphone link via text message to upload documents and complete identification.

### Do I Need ID Verification for Every Booking?

No, once successfully completed, ID verification is not required for future bookings.

### Why Did My ID Verification Fail?

Ensure photographs are sharp, well-lit, and avoid reflections. Don't cover documents and take recent photos of yourself.

### Can I Retry Failed ID Verification?

Yes, you can repeat the ID verification process if documents weren't recognised.

### Why Might Pay Monthly Be Declined?

Our partner PayLater conducts online checks that may be declined for various reasons including creditworthiness, contradictory information, or unpaid PayLater invoices. More details available on the PayLater website.

### How Do I Receive PayLater Invoices?

PayLater issues invoices via email within 24-48 hours. Individual invoices are free when paid on time. Outstanding amounts are consolidated into monthly statements sent by post with a £2.50 processing fee.

### Payment Periods and Reminder Fees

**Individual Invoice**: Must be paid within 15 days of email receipt via online banking. Post office payments incur additional costs.
**Monthly Invoice**: Payment due by month end using the provided payment slip.

### Is Partial Payment Possible?

Yes, partial payments between 10% and 100% of the total amount are accepted for both individual and monthly invoices.

### When Are Reminder Fees Charged?

Late payment of monthly invoices incurs reminder fees: £12 for the first reminder, £20 for the second reminder.

### How Do Refunds Work with Pay Monthly?

Refunds depend on cancellation timing:
- If invoice is paid: Refund via bank transfer
- If PayLater is notified before payment period ends: New invoice issued for adjusted amount
- If notification is after payment period: Monthly invoice issued with £2.50 processing fee minus refund amount

### Do I Need to Pay Before Travel?

## Frequently Asked Questions: UK Fare Structure

No. As long as Standard Class seats are available, all Standard fare types remain available in every booking class.

### Can UKConnect Fares Be Booked on Partner Rail Services?

Standard, Flexible, and First Class fares can be booked on partner rail services. Advance fares can only be booked on UKConnect-operated services. Seat reservations may not be available on all partner services.

### Why Doesn't UKConnect Offer Flexible Fares for Groups?

Group bookings can be changed free of charge until ticket issue, provided the same price remains available. Flexible fares therefore provide no additional group benefit.

### Can Additional Options Always Be Changed?

Additional options cannot be changed with Advance fares as the fare itself cannot be modified. With Standard fares, additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.

If you've booked Advance, Standard, or Flexible fares, you can upgrade to First Class, which includes many First Class services. Upgrades are bookable via ukconnect.com or the UKConnect Service Centre.

### What Are Mile/Point Credit Differences?

Point credits are still determined by the booking class and fare type purchased.

### If I Book an Advance Fare with Paid Extras and Cancel, Do I Lose Everything?

Like Advance fares, charges for paid extras are non-refundable and cannot be transferred to different journeys.

No refunds are given for included fare services that aren't used (e.g., seat reservations, lounge access).

### First vs Additional Luggage

First luggage can only be purchased with Advance fares and costs less than additional luggage items.

## Pricing & Fare Structure

1. **Why do train prices vary throughout the day?**

Train pricing follows demand-based and time-of-day structures. Peak hours (7-9 AM, 5-7 PM weekdays) have higher demand and premium pricing. Off-peak and Super Off-peak times offer discounted fares to encourage travel during quieter periods. Weekend pricing typically follows off-peak rates except for popular tourist routes.

2. **What are the specific off-peak times and discounts?**

**Off-Peak Times:**
- Weekdays: 9:30 AM - 4:30 PM, after 7:00 PM
- Weekends: All day Saturday and Sunday
- Public holidays: All day

**Super Off-Peak Times:**
- Weekdays: 10:00 AM - 3:30 PM, after 8:00 PM
- Weekends: All day

Off-peak discounts range from 20-40% off peak fares. Super off-peak offers 30-50% discounts. Specific times may vary by route and are clearly displayed during booking.

3. **How are fare categories A-H and J-S structured?**

Fare categories indicate pricing levels within each class:
- **A-H (Standard Class)**: A is most expensive peak fare, H is cheapest off-peak
- **J-M (First Class)**: J is premium peak fare, M is discounted off-peak
- **P-S (Advance/Promotional)**: Special advance purchase and promotional fares

Each category has different flexibility, cancellation terms, and availability windows. Higher letter categories generally offer more restrictions but lower prices.

4. **What determines the price difference between Standard and Flexible fares?**

Flexible fares cost 15-35% more than Standard fares but include: free cancellation up to 24 hours before departure, free changes up to 2 hours before departure, no advance purchase requirements, and full refunds for delays over 2 hours. Standard fares have restricted change/cancellation policies but offer significant savings.

5. **Are there seasonal pricing variations?**

Yes, seasonal variations apply to popular routes:
- **Summer (June-August)**: 10-25% premium on tourist routes
- **Christmas/New Year (Dec 20-Jan 5)**: 15-30% premium on most routes  
- **Bank holidays**: 10-20% premium depending on route popularity
- **School holidays**: Variable pricing on family-oriented routes

Advance booking (7+ days) can minimize seasonal premiums.

6. **How does distance affect pricing?**

UKConnect uses zone-based pricing combined with distance calculations. Short journeys (under 50 miles) have flat-rate pricing. Medium distances (50-200 miles) use linear distance pricing. Long journeys (200+ miles) include zone premiums for major city connections and may offer better per-mile value for advance bookings.

7. **What are the current price ranges for major routes?**

**Sample Route Pricing (Standard/Flexible/First Class):**
- London-Manchester: £45-65 / £60-85 / £95-140
- London-Edinburgh: £65-95 / £85-125 / £145-220  
- Birmingham-Glasgow: £55-80 / £75-105 / £120-180
- Liverpool-London: £50-75 / £70-95 / £110-165

2. **How do I apply for a student discount?**

Register online at ukconnect.com/students with your student ID, full-time enrollment verification, and university email address. You'll receive a student railcard number that can be applied during booking. The railcard costs £30 annually and pays for itself with just a few journeys.

3. **What is UKConnect's best price guarantee?**

If you find a lower fare for the same journey on a competitor's website within 24 hours of booking, we'll refund the difference plus an additional 10% discount voucher. This applies to Standard and Flexible fares on like-for-like services. Submit price match requests through our website with competitor booking details.

4. **Do student discounts apply to First Class tickets?**

Student discounts apply to Standard and Flexible fares only. However, students can upgrade to First Class at a reduced rate when purchasing their initial ticket. Student upgrades to First Class receive a 20% discount off the standard upgrade fee.

5. **Can students use the student discount with other promotional offers?**

Student discounts cannot be combined with other promotional codes or group booking discounts. However, the student discount automatically applies to the lowest available fare in each booking class, ensuring you always receive the best student price.

6. **What happens if I book without applying my student discount?**

If you forget to apply your student discount during booking, contact customer service within 24 hours with your booking reference and student railcard number. We can process a partial refund for the discount amount for bookings that haven't been used for travel.

1. **Are mobile tickets accepted on UKConnect trains?**

Yes, mobile tickets are fully accepted on all UKConnect services. You can display your e-ticket confirmation on your smartphone screen to train staff and ticket inspectors. Mobile tickets are stored securely in the UKConnect app and can be accessed offline once downloaded.

2. **Can I manage my bookings through the UKConnect mobile app?**

Yes, the UKConnect app allows you to view, modify, and cancel bookings. You can access your booking history, download mobile tickets, receive real-time journey updates, and manage your customer profile. However, some advanced features like voucher redemption and complex multi-leg bookings are currently available only via desktop.

3. **What happens if my phone battery dies and I can't show my mobile ticket?**

If your mobile device is unavailable, you can provide your booking reference number to train staff who can verify your ticket in their system. We recommend taking a screenshot of your ticket or noting your booking reference as backup. Physical tickets can be collected from station machines using your booking reference if needed.

4. **Can I transfer mobile tickets to another device?**

Mobile tickets are linked to your UKConnect account and can be accessed from any device where you log in to the app or website. However, tickets cannot be transferred to other people's accounts or devices without proper rebooking procedures.

5. **Are there any limitations with mobile tickets compared to physical tickets?**

Mobile tickets have the same functionality as physical tickets. However, some station facilities and partner services may have limited smartphone integration. For business expense purposes, mobile tickets serve as valid receipts and can be forwarded to accounting departments.

## Ticket Modifications & Transfers

1. **Can I transfer my ticket to another person?**

Standard and First Class tickets are non-transferable between passengers. The passenger name must match valid photo ID for travel. However, Flexible fares allow name changes up to 24 hours before departure for a £25 administration fee, provided the new passenger meets all travel requirements.

2. **What are the detailed fees for ticket modifications?**

Modification fees vary by fare type: Standard fares incur £25-£75 change fees depending on timing and route. Flexible fares allow free changes up to 2 hours before departure. First Class tickets have change fees of £25-£100. Same-day changes cost an additional £15. Weekend and peak-time changes may incur premium rates.

3. **Can I change my ticket to a different route or destination?**

Route changes are treated as new bookings rather than modifications. You must cancel your original ticket (subject to cancellation fees) and purchase a new ticket for the different route. The price difference and applicable fees will apply. This policy ensures fare integrity across our network pricing structure.

4. **How late can I modify my booking before departure?**

Online modifications are possible up to 2 hours before departure for most stations. Major stations like London terminals, Manchester Piccadilly, and Birmingham New Street allow changes up to 1 hour before departure. Station ticket offices can process changes up to 30 minutes before departure with additional fees.

5. **What happens if I miss my train after modifying my booking?**

If you miss your rescheduled train, the same fare conditions apply as your modified ticket type. Flexible fare holders can take the next available service without additional charges. Standard fare holders must purchase a new ticket unless they have valid reasons (medical emergency, transport delays affecting your journey to the station).

6. **Can I modify tickets purchased with promotional codes or vouchers?**

Tickets purchased with promotional codes or vouchers have restricted modification rights. Most promotional fares allow date/time changes for a higher fee (£35-£50) but route changes are not permitted. Voucher-purchased tickets must be cancelled and rebought if significant changes are needed, subject to voucher terms.

7. **Are group booking modifications handled differently?**

Group bookings (3+ passengers) can be modified up to 48 hours before departure. Individual passenger changes within a group booking incur standard modification fees per person. Entire group modifications may qualify for reduced per-person fees. Groups of 10+ passengers receive dedicated support for complex modifications.

## Flexible Fare Policies

1. **What is the specific 24-hour cancellation policy for Flexible fares?**

Flexible fares can be cancelled up to 24 hours before scheduled departure without any penalty fees, receiving a full refund to the original payment method. Cancellations within 24 hours but more than 2 hours before departure incur a £15 service fee. Cancellations within 2 hours of departure forfeit 50% of the ticket value as a cancellation fee.

2. **How do Flexible fare changes work compared to Standard fares?**

Flexible fares allow unlimited free changes (date, time, train service) up to 2 hours before departure. Changes within 2 hours incur a £10 same-day change fee. Standard fares require £25-£75 change fees depending on timing and route, with no free change window. First Class Flexible fares follow the same terms but apply to First Class inventory.

3. **Can Flexible fare holders take any train on their travel date?**

Yes, Flexible fare holders can take any UKConnect service on their booked date without advance rebooking. If your original train is cancelled or significantly delayed, you can board any alternative service that day. This same-day flexibility is the key benefit distinguishing Flexible from Standard fares.

4. **What happens if I miss my Flexible fare train?**

Flexible fare holders can take the next available service on the same day at no additional cost. If travelling the next day, standard rebooking policies apply (free changes up to 24 hours before the new departure time). This flexibility makes Flexible fares ideal for business travel with uncertain timing.

5. **Do Flexible fares include any additional services beyond flexibility?**

Yes, Flexible fares include: priority customer service, enhanced delay compensation (full refund for delays over 30 minutes), complimentary seat reservations where available, and automatic rebooking on alternative services during disruptions. These services are included in the Flexible fare premium.

6. **How do refunds work for partially used Flexible return tickets?**

For Flexible return tickets, unused portions can be refunded up to the original validity period. If you've used the outbound journey, the return portion can be refunded minus a £10 processing fee if cancelled more than 24 hours before the return departure. Within 24 hours, standard Flexible cancellation terms apply to the unused portion.

7. **Can I upgrade a Standard fare to Flexible after booking?**

Yes, Standard fares can be upgraded to Flexible by paying the fare difference plus a £15 upgrade processing fee. This upgrade must be completed at least 2 hours before departure and is subject to Flexible fare availability on your specific service. The upgrade provides full Flexible benefits from the point of processing.
